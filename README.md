# CPSC-380-Assignment7
 
 * Some ideas I had are from the slides. Basically the scheduling algorithm is the disk arm going back and forth to access the cylinders. 

 * There are some great visuals of this on the slides here: https://canvas.chapman.edu/courses/44406/files/4171907?module_item_id=1505005 (this is ch11)

* Store all of the values from cylinders.txt in an array
* For some of the algorithms we will need to create a method to sort from least to greatest
* The value we are calculating is how far we travel when we move across a cylinder for example going from 156 to 136 is 20 cylinders moved
